I got my PhD from [The University of Chicago](https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/) in 2020. My research area is natural language processing. 

I am currently a software engineer at [Google](https://www.google.com/), working on the search engine ranking algorithms. 

I am broadly interested in learning more about the world and about ourselves.
