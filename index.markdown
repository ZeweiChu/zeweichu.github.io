I am passionate about metaverse and blockchain these days, and I would love to remove the barrier of distance for people all over the world, hence everyone is able to live and work everywhere on the earth.

I got my PhD from [The University of Chicago](https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/) in 2020. My research area was natural language processing.
